## The Open API Specification - V2.0  (f.k.a. Swagger Specification)

The OpenAPI Specification (originally known as the Swagger Specification) is a specification for machine-readable interface files for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services. (Quoted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification))

Swagger™ is a project used to describe and document RESTful APIs.
