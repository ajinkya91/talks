# The dark days before DevOps

* Developers, Testers & SysAdmins
* Functionally Separated 
* Blame Culture
* Buggy Code
* Insanely longer deployment process

#### DevOps is a development methodology with a set of practices aimed at bridging the gap between Development and Operations, emphasizing communication and collaboration, continuous integration, quality assurance and delivery with automated deployment - Wikipedia

# DevOps Engg. != SysAdmin

* SysAdmins are people who manually deploy other people's code on a server, provided Devs provide them with dependencies. More often than not Code is a black box to them.
* DevOps Engineers are either developers who get interested in deployment and network operations, or sysadmins who have a passion for scripting and coding, and move into the development side where they can improve the planning of test and deployment.

# True Story

Building Device iOS and Android Device Farm @ Appknox

# Containers (Docker &  rkt)

---

# 12 Factor App

I. **Codebase** - One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
II. **Dependencies** - Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
III. **Config** - Store config in the environment
IV. **Backing services** - Treat backing services as attached resources
V. **Build, release, run** - Strictly separate build and run stages
VI. **Processes** - Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

---
# ..contd

VII. **Port binding** - Export services via port binding
VIII. **Concurrency** - Scale out via the process model
IX. **Disposability** - Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
X. **Dev/prod parity** - Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
XI. **Logs** - Treat logs as event streams
XII. **Admin processes** - Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
